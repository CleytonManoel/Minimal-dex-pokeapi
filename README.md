## Objetive

The aim of the project is to create a web pokedex with minimal functions related to pokemons (name, pokedex number and status).

## Search Forms

### The project has three forms for search pokemons.

- the first is by buttons in pokedex.
- the second is writing the name for pokemon in search bar.
- the third is writing the pokedex number of the pokemon.

## Responsiveness

The project is far from being an example of responsiveness, it is just responsive enough to show all the necessary information on mobile devices.
